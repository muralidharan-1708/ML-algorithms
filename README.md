Classic machine learning algorithms applied to real-world datasets:

| Model            | Dataset                           | Task         |
|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| Decision Tree    | Diabetes                          | Classification |
| KNN              | Customer Churn                    | Classification |
| Linear Regression| Real Estate                       | Regression   |
| Logistic Regression | Titanic Survival               | Classification |
| Naive Bayes      | Weather                           | Classification |
| Random Forest    | Lung Cancer                       | Classification |
